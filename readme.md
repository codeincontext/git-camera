Delorean
===

Have you ever finished a website and thought about how the design/build has evolved to get where it is now? Well Delorean is for you!

Delorean goes through your (web) project's git commits, and records a video of how the interface has changed over time. It's a little window into your build process - Use it for your own curiosity, show it to your client, your boss, investors, your cat, I don't mind.

Requirements
---

PhantomJS - An environment to render the page
`brew update && brew install phantomjs`

FFmpeg - It can make a video from still images

Ruby - It's a programming language.
